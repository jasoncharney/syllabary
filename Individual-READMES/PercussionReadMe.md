# Percussion Readme

Arrange instruments in a row as follows across the top of the score:

5 temple blocks, large suspended cymbal, snare drum (snare off), medium metal mixing bowl with ~10-15 marbles or ball bearings inside, glockenspiel *[I'm going to change this to an unpitched or semi-pitched instrument like cut metal pipes or tambourine to avoid putting in a box with notation like I had originally planned]*

Lines from the boxes indicate approximate position to play on the instrument from left to right. For temple blocks/glock, they indicate register/individual block, and for the other instruments it's general position around the center of the instrument. These position indications are more to demonstrate gestures and movement, generally controlled by LFOs, so don't worry too much about them.

The colors inside each technique box indicate the dynamic/envelope to perform the indicated technique. For scraping, striking, and bouncing techqniues, perform once per envelope; for the others, perform continuously, changing dynamic according to the color. Red = *f*, purple = *mf/mp*, blue = *p*

## *Implements*
The bottom two boxes show the implements to be used in left and right hands. Change implements as quickly as possible when indicated.

## *Techniques*

These techniques allow quite a bit of latitude as their meaning is flexible depending on the instrument.

| Technique                                                                                                                                                                                              | Symbol                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| Scrape once from an edge of the instrument towards the center, stopping at indicated position                                                                                                          | ![scrapetocenter](https://github.com/jasoncharney/syllabary/blob/master/readme-imgs/scrapetocenter.png?raw=true) |
| Scrape once from the center                                                                                                                                                                            | ![scrapetoedge](https://github.com/jasoncharney/syllabary/blob/master/readme-imgs/scrapetoedge.png?raw=true)     |
| Continuously swirl on the top of the instrument with the implement. Dynamic may indicate speed, width of movement, or pressure                                                                         | ![swirl](https://github.com/jasoncharney/syllabary/blob/master/readme-imgs/swirl.png?raw=true)                   |
| Bounce implement and allow rebounding with *dim.* over course of envelope. *Ad lib* rhythm.                                                                                                            | ![bounce](https://github.com/jasoncharney/syllabary/blob/master/readme-imgs/bounce.png?raw=true)                 |
| Hit center/sounding surface of the instrument with a normal stroke, at the dynamic indicated by the envelope color (more detail indications below table). Repeat stroke only with envelope indication. | ![hitcenter](https://github.com/jasoncharney/syllabary/blob/master/readme-imgs/hitcenter.png?raw=true)           |
| Hit edge (perpendicular to ground) of instrument (see extra indications below)                                                                                                                         | ![hiteedge](https://github.com/jasoncharney/syllabary/blob/master/readme-imgs/hitedge.png?raw=true)              |
| Splatter: continuously strike with quick, dense, but irregular hits at indicated dynamic and position.                                                                                                 | ![splatter](https://github.com/jasoncharney/syllabary/blob/master/readme-imgs/smatter.png?raw=true)              |





#### Hit center/edge extra info:
***Hit center:***

Temple blocks: hit the center of the indicated (or closest) block.

**Cymbal:** hit on top with normal stroke, but around the cymbal as indicated with the position line.

**Snare drum:** same as cymbal, moving around head

**Bowl:** strike the marbles inside the bowl â€“ otherwise position doesn't really matter.

**Glock:** hit any pitch in register indicated by position line

***Hit edge:***

**Snare:** on rim, around the edge as indicated by position line

**Bowl:** on rim, around the edge as indicated by position line

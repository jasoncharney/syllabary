# Percussion Readme

Arrange instruments in a row as follows across the top:

5 temple blocks, large suspended cymbal, snare drum (snare off), medium metal mixing bowl with ~10-15 marbles or large ball bearings inside, glockenspiel *[I'm thinking about changing this to an unpitched instrument]*

## *Implements*
The bottom two boxes show the implements to be used in left and right hands. Change implements as quickly as possible when indicated.

## *Techniques*

These techniques allow quite a bit of latitude as their meaning is flexible depending on the instrument.

| Technique                                                                                                                                                                                              | Symbol                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| Scrape from an edge of the instrument towards the center, stopping at indicated position                                                                                                               | ![scrapetocenter](https://github.com/jasoncharney/syllabary/blob/master/readme-imgs/scrapetocenter.png?raw=true) |
| Scrape from the center                                                                                                                                                                                 | ![scrapetoedge](https://github.com/jasoncharney/syllabary/blob/master/readme-imgs/scrapetoedge.png?raw=true)     |
| Swirl on the top of the instrument with the implement. Dynamic may indicate speed, width of movement, or pressure                                                                                      | ![swirl](https://github.com/jasoncharney/syllabary/blob/master/readme-imgs/swirl.png?raw=true)                   |
| Bounce implement and allow rebounding with *dim.* over course of envelope. *Ad lib* rhythm.                                                                                                            | ![bounce](https://github.com/jasoncharney/syllabary/blob/master/readme-imgs/bounce.png?raw=true)                 |
| Hit center/sounding surface of the instrument with a normal stroke, at the dynamic indicated by the envelope color (more detail indications below table). Repeat stroke only with envelope indication. | ![hitcenter](https://github.com/jasoncharney/syllabary/blob/master/readme-imgs/hitcenter.png?raw=true)           |
| Hit edge (perpendicular to ground) of instrument (see extra indications below)                                                                                                                         | ![hiteedge](https://github.com/jasoncharney/syllabary/blob/master/readme-imgs/hitedge.png?raw=true)              |
| Splatter: strike with quick, dense, but irregular hits at indicated dynamic and position.                                                                                                              | ![splatter](https://github.com/jasoncharney/syllabary/blob/master/readme-imgs/smatter.png?raw=true)              |





#### Hit center/edge extra info:
***Hit center:***

Temple blocks: hit the center of the indicated (or closest) block.

**Cymbal:** hit on top with normal stroke, but around the cymbal as indicated with the position line.

**Snare drum:** same as cymbal, moving around head

**Bowl:** strike the marbles inside the bowl â€“ otherwise position doesn't really matter.

**Glock:** hit any pitch in register indicated by position line

***Hit edge:***

**Snare:** on rim, around the edge as indicated by position line

**Bowl:** on rim, around the edge as indicated by position line

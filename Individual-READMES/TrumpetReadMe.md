***Note box:*** Shows note to play or extended technique. Two boxes are displayed, but only one is active at a time, indicated by the color of the box (which matches the envelope airspeed). They may switch rapidly, independent of envelope.

Notes on the staff are played with full tone, but with dynamic according to airspeed/dynamic envelope.

Ram = percussive press of the indicated valves + articulation with loose embouchure (so as not to produce a pitch), followed by airstream. 

Ruffle = quickly move valves while blowing air without pitch (independent speed from air – watch valves).

***Airspeed/dynamic:*** Shows envelope of each note. Wider/redder = louder or quicker air, narrower/bluer = softer/slower air. Rearticulate (with indicated articulation) if the stream disappears. If you run out of air before the stream disappears, rearticulate with the currently-displayed articulation. 

***Articulation:*** Sfort, staccato, tenuto, marcato, flz (marked as a triple-beam tremolo), or slur. Indicates how to articulate each envelope. The envelope should match the articulation marked for the note length. For flz, try to flutter for as much of the envelope as possible. Slur indicates no rearticulation between switching notes. Or, if going from unpitched technique to playback of a note, use a very soft articulation.

**NB**: ruffle valve movement is independent of air stream (watch the speed they move). You may be moving valves without blowing air. Ram the indicated valve combination at the beginning of each air envelope.

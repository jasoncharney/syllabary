# Trumpet ReadMe

Use a Trumpet in C. If you'd prefer Bb let me know and I can transpose all the pitch collections.

***Note box:*** Shows note to play or extended technique. Ram = percussive press of the indicated valves + articulation, followed by air without pitch. Ruffle = quickly move valves while blowing air without pitch (indepdent speed from air – watch valves). Notes are played with full tone, but with dynamic according to airspeed/dynamic envelope. Which note or techqniue to play is indicated by the color of the box, which changes with the airspeed/dynamic indication color.

***Airspeed/dynamic:*** Shows envelope of each note. Wider/redder = louder or quicker air, narrower/bluer = softer/slower air. Rearticulate (with indicated articulation) if the stream disappears. If you run out of air before the stream disappears, rearticulate with the currently-displayed articulation. 

***Articulation:*** Sfort, staccato, tenuto, marcato, flz (marked as a triple-beam tremolo), or slur. Indicates how to begin each note. Slur indicates no rearticulation between switching notes. Or, if going from unpitched technique to playback of a note, use a very soft articulation.

**NB**: ruffle valve movement is independent of air stream. You may be moving valves without blowing air. Ram the indicated pitch at the beginning of each air envelope.

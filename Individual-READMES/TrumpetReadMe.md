***Play arrow:*** Indicates which note or technique to play. Can switch rapidly to indicate quick alternation between notes or techniques.

***Note box:*** Shows note to play or extended technique. Ram = percussive press of the indicated valves + articulation, followed by air without pitch. Ruffle = quickly move valves while blowing air without pitch (indepdent speed from air â€“ watch valves). Notes are played with full tone, but with dynamic according to airspeed/dynamic envelope.

***Airspeed/dynamic:*** Shows envelope of each note. Wider/redder = louder or quicker air, narrower/bluer = softer/slower air. Rearticulate (with indicated articulation) if the stream disappears.

***Articulation:*** Sfort, staccato, tenuto, marcato, flz (marked as a triple-beam tremolo), or slur. Indicates how to begin each note. Slur indicates no rearticulation if the play arrow switches in the middle of an envelope.

# **Piano Instructions**

In general, ad lib articulations but play with an impressionistic, blurry kind of sound with ample pedaling.

Piano note boxes show short phrases or pitches to play. All are notated within one octave, their alignment across the top indicates which register they should be played in.

A yellow border around the box indicates to play the pitch collection as a chord; otherwise, play individual notes at a regular rhythm. The note rhythm indicated under the staff is not necessarily a strict duration, but relative duration. E.g. a phrase marked with an eighth note should be played about twice as fast as one with a sixteenth note.

The changing color of the boxes will indicate dynamics: red = *f*, blue = *p*. 

If a fermata is above the box, play the phrase/chord once and hold the last note until the color fades. If a repeat symbol is above the box, play the phrase at the indicated dynamic, cresc./dim. as it gets louder (redder) or softer (bluer).
